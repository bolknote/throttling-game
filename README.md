# The Throttling Game (for MacOS)

"The Throttling Game" — a quirky nuclear power plant operator simulator where your Caps Lock key becomes the ultimate lifeline in a race against catastrophe. After a critical system failure, you must manually stabilize the reactor’s temperature by toggling Caps Lock: turn it on to load the CPU (heating the core) or off to let it "cool down."

The CPU load graph in your Resource Monitor doubles as a reactor temperature gauge — keep it between 10% and 90% to avoid a meltdown or a shutdown. With just four seconds to prep, a stress-inducing real-world interface (set Resource Monitor to "Very Often" updates!), and the constant dread of tipping into chaos, this is a digital adrenaline rush for fans of absurd, high-stakes micromanagement. Can you juggle boiling hell and frozen doom with just one key?

To play the game, open the `Resource Monitor` and display the `CPU load graph`. Set the update frequency (under `View` → `Update Frequency`) to "`Very Often`".
